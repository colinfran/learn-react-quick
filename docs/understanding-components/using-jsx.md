# Using JSX to Create Elements

JSX is a powerful syntax extension that simplifies the process of creating React elements. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to visualize and build the UI. JSX elements can represent both built-in HTML elements and custom React components.

Example of JSX elements:
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
      <p>This is a JSX element representing a simple component.</p>
      <button>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
