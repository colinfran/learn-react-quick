# Setting up the Development Environment

Before we dive into creating React applications, let's set up our development environment to ensure we have all the necessary tools in place.

## Installing Node.js and npm

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it suitable for server-side applications and development tools. It comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager), which we will use to manage our project's dependencies.

To install Node.js and npm, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
4. After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to verify that Node.js and npm are installed:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

   You should see the version numbers of Node.js and npm printed in the terminal if the installation was successful.

## Download Code Editor
There are literally so many code editors to choose from its impossible to list them all here. I will, however, list the most popular ones and the links to download them.

- [VS Code - \*\*Author's choice\*\*](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download)

- [WebStorm - \*\*Requires subscription - free for students\*\*](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=mac)
