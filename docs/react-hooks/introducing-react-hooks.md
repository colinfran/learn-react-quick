# Introducing React Hooks

In this lesson, you will be introduced to React Hooks, a feature introduced in React 16.8. Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They provide a more concise and flexible way to work with stateful logic in functional components.

## What are React Hooks:
React Hooks are functions that enable you to use state and other React features in functional components. Prior to Hooks, stateful logic was primarily managed in class components using the state property. Now, with Hooks, you can achieve similar functionality in functional components, making them more powerful and reusable.

## Built-in Hooks:
React comes with several built-in Hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and more. Each Hook serves a specific purpose and simplifies different aspects of state and lifecycle management.

## Rules for Using Hooks:
There are some rules to follow when using Hooks:
- Hooks can only be used in functional components and not in regular JavaScript functions.
- Hooks should always be called at the top level of a functional component and not within loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Hooks should have consistent names and cannot be conditionally called.
